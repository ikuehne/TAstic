Overview of the Docs
--------------------

TAstic is divided into two pieces: a Python library, ``libtastic``, and the
``tastic`` command-line tool.  The docs are accordingly divided into two pieces:
API documentation and usage documentation.  If you wish to extend TAstic or
understand how it works, start with :ref:`the API documentation<libtastic>`.  If
you just want to use it as a command-line tool, start with :ref:`the tool
documentation<intro>`.
